* TODOs
** TODO investigate dynamic objects
*** add visualization: After reconstructing a 3D point $P$ at $t_{i+1}$, project P in the image at $t_i$ and print line connecting it with the 2D feature correspondence from $p_i$, which has been used for reconstruction.
*** $\rightarrow$ the goal is to identify dynamic objects during reconstruction to become more robust to violations of the static underlying scene assumption
** TODO define arrays like indices, points2D and points3D global in MotionEstimation to reduce arguments in functions -> or maybe save directly in frame class
** TODO make frame class
** TODO clear interface in the end, i.e. delete redundant arrays and refactor classes
** TODO refactor function: matchCorrORBEpiConstraint
*** in for loops replace int -> size_t
*** in for loops pre instead postincrement (++i)
** TODO add SFMViz from L_SLAM code for more interactive visualization
